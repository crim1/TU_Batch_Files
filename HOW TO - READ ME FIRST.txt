Crim1 Batch files for Optmization automation
Release 1.0 - Files:
	Start Here.bat  	- easy menu to start with. Should be the starting point
	MassGWtest.bat  	- called from the Start Here batch, will walk you through a GW optimization
	MassBWLtest.bat 	- called from the Start Here batch, will walk you through a BRAWL optimization
	gwPlayerTest.BGE.bat 	- called from the MassGWtest.bat, calls TUO program for GW with background effect
	gwPlayerTest.bat	- called from the MassGWtest.bat, calls TUO program for GW without background effect
	bwlPlayerTest.BGE.bat	- called from the MassBWLtest.bat, calls TUO program for GW with background effect
	bwlPlayerTest.bat	- called from the MassBWLtest.bat, calls TUO program for GW without background effect
	members.txt		- both guild war and brawl optimization batches look at this list to determine who to test
	SOURCE.txt		- Enemy deck sets

***************************************************************************************************************************
Features:
	The guild war and brawl optimizations are designed to be mass testing tools. They will look at the list of names in
	the members.txt file and optimize every person on that list. This list can be 1 name, or 50, or 100. Each member to 
	be tested must have an inventory file in the data directory with their name (matching the entry in members.txt). 
	The batch will ask if you want to update members.txt each time you are setting up an optimization run.
		NOTE: Do not leave a blank line at the end of the members.txt

	The optimization batch files will ask for the following:
		- A background effect (or none)
		- how many threads to run with (4 is default, 6 to 8 for an i7 computer if you want to use more power)
		- the climb amount
		NOte: Brawl Optimizations are done in ORDERED mode to produce optimal results but this takes longer to run
			I recommend no more than 1000 for ordered brawl but you can go higher for an overnight run
		- Enemy sets:
			*220K - toughest set
			*215K - broader but still tough
			*210K - "Last Generation" of tough sets
		Note: I will be adding guild specific gauntlets as we approach the guild war

	The optimization batch will look at the current deck of the player in their inventory:
		//Current Deck: Commander, Card 1, Card 2, Card 3, etc
	And place this into the customdecks.txt file. The batch knows enough to not repeat names so there should be no 
	overlap.

	The output of each Brawl and Guild War are text files in a comma seperated format with a header row. Both are easy
	to copy/paste into a spreadsheet. I may consider updating the files from .txt to .csv so the conversion to excel is
	even easier.
***************************************************************************************************************************
How to use:
	Any file ending in .bat should be located in the same directory as the TUO optimizer program
	SOURCE.txt should be located in the data directory
	members.txt should be located in a folder called members which you will need to create in the data directory
	All player inventory files should be located in the data directory

	Once all this is in place, you should just need to run the Start Here.bat file
	Note: I used "relative paths" so you don't need to update your directories or anything in the batch. That said, 
		people have had path issues before because of naming. Please let me know if anything like that comes up.
***************************************************************************************************************************
Setting up an inventory file:
	The player's name isn't necessary, it's just a reference and is commented out
	The current deck is necessary as the batch will insert it into the customdecks.txt and TUO requires it there 
		At least the way i have it running. Don't worry, it won't overlap
	I ask people to insert an //OR when they have materials that conflict. For example, if i have 4 Aegis i can make
		Sculpted Aegis or 2 Steel Rams so I would ask them to do this:
			Sculpted Aegis
			//OR
			Steel Ram (2)
		If the optimization then shows me that both happen to be included in the player's best deck, I run 2 
		optimizations to see which score better. Eventually I may be able to think of a programatic solution
		but not yet.
Sample Inventory file, to be named: Crim1.txt - the members.txt file would just say: Crim1

//Crim1: 
Halcyon
Tabitha
Barracus
Typhon Vex
Dracorex
Petrisis
Constantine
Alaric
Nexor
Krellus
//Current Deck: Halcyon, Tundra MK3, Octane's Bulwark, Auger Ream, Hephatat Stoic, Sacred Sanctuary, Bane of Truth, Dreamhaunter
Sacred Sanctuary (2)
Trampling Anvil
Tazerious
Steel Ram (3)
//OR
Auger Ream 
Bane of Truth
Tundra MK3
Scorched Hellwing

	NOTE: When copy/pasting from a google spreadsheet, watch out for quotation marks at the start and end of the inventory list
		And watch out for tab spaces like this -->	tada	more	space	
		These cause a TUO to crash
